# HI HENRY

![Splash Image](splash.jpg)

## Introduction

The purpose of "Hi Henry" is to generate [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io) classes based on the tables defined in a database.  The applicaton 
currently only supports the MySQL database system.  But has been designed to be extended to support other DBMS systems
through a plugin architecture and a data type mapping mechanisim.

## Install

The application as been designed as a runnable folder.  Simply download a copy of the source code to a
folder and run it using the commands and parameters described below.

## Usage

The application provides a command line interface and supports the following four commands:

| Command  | Description                                                         |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| create   | creates a new configuration which can be used used to generate code |
| delete   | deletes a previously created configuration                          |
| generate | generates code based on a configuration                             |
| clear    | deletes previously generated code                                   |

### create

This command defines a new configuration that can be used to connect to a database and extract its schema.  The 
command accepts the following parametrs:

| Parameter | Description                                               | Required | Default   |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------|
| database  | The name of the database to use in generating code        | Yes      |           |
| user      | The name of the database to use in generating code        | Yes      |           | 
| passport  | The user password to use to connect to the database       | Yes      |           |
| driver    | The database management system (DBMS) hostig the database | No       | mysql     |
| host      | The host where which the DBMS is running                  | No       | 127.0.0.1 | 
| port      | The port on which the DMBS is listening                   | No       | 3306      |

The driver parameter currently only supports one option - mysql, others may be added later.

### delete

This command deletes a configuration, previously created with the creaet command.  The command requires the following 
parameter:

| Parameter | Description                                               | Required | Default   |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------|
| database  | The name of the database to use in generating code        | Yes      |           |

### generate

This command generaets the code. The command supports the following parameter:

| Parameter | Description                                          | Required | Default |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|
| database  | The name of the database to use in generating code   | Yes      |         |
| folder    | If provided, code will be generated in this folder   | No       |         |

### clear

This command deletes the contents of the folder where the generated code was stored.  Optionally the default folder can 
be overwritten.

| Parameter | Description                                          | Required | Default |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|
| folder    | If provided, code will be generated in this folder   | No       |         |

## Design

### Concept

This utility can be used to generate a set of Data Trasfer Objects (DTO) based on a database schema.  The DTOs are 
based on the [Pydanic package](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io).

The tool supports a particular database design pattern:

- Each table as an id field that uniquely identifiies the record in the table.  If the name is capitalised (ID), it is generated by the DBMS.
- The table may have a candidate key also marked as unique
- Each table has a lock_version field that is used to support optimistic concurrency.
- Each table has a created_at field that indicates when the record was created
- Each table has an updated_at field that indicates when the record was last updated
- Enums are favoured over triggers and constraints
- Table creating and seed data insertion are scripted

```mermaid
    erDiagram
        data_table {
            ID int
            lock_version smallint
            created_at timestamp
            updated_at timestamp
        }
        xxx_data_table {
            ID int
            action enum
            logged_at timestamp
            record_id int
            record_lock_version_id smallint
        }
```

When actions need to be audited a second table with same name prefixed with xxx is created.  And each change is logged 
to this table.

When a new record is inserted into the table, the lock_version field is set to 1 and the created_at and updated_at 
fields are  set to the current date and time.  If the action needs to be audited then a new record must be created in 
the corresponding xxx table.  Each table has its own audit tabe to reduce the possibilities of a bottle neck that can 
occur in using a centeral logging table.

When a record is changed the following must occur:

- The lock_versin number must be incremented by one
- The updated_at field must be set to the current date and time
- If an audit is required, then an entry must be created in the corresponding xxx table

### Configuration

All the configuration files are stored in the config folder.

#### Logging

The application logging is configured via the logging.cfg file.  Logging is configured to write to three files, 
as follows:

| File         | Description                                                                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| main.log     | All log messages are written to this file                                            |
| error.log    | This file is used to log all error messages and above, to make it easy to find them. |
| activity.log | This file is used to detail the steps in the process of generating code              |

The root logger is configured to:
- Log all messages to the main.log file
- Log error messages to the error.log
- Log error messages to the console

A second logger (progress_logger) is configured to:
- Log Info and above messages to the activity.log file to show how the application goes through the process of generating code.
- Propigate the messages to teh root logger


#### Plugin

The information for configurng the plugins is stored in the system.toml file and consists of two parts:

- The plugin entry which defines the plugin 
- The data map entry which maps the database types to the Python and Pydantic data types


### Schema Model

The schema model is represented by a series of associated interfaces, which must be provided by all plugins.

```mermaid
    classDiagram
    
    class ITable{
        <<interface>>
        +str name
        List~IColumn~ columns
        List~IIndex~ indexes
        List~IForeignKey~ foreign_keys 
    }
            
    class IDatabase{
        <<interface>>
        +str name
        List~ITable~ tables
        List~IView~ views
        List~IProcedure~ procedures
    }   
    
    class IColumn{
        <<interface>>
        +int order
        +str name
        +str type
        +int length
        +str default
        +bool is_nullable
        +bool is_key
        +bool is_unqiue
    }   
            
    IDatabase ..> ITable
    ITable ..> IColumn
```
